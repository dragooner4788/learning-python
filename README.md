Learning Python General

This is my main repo for learning Python.

## What's in this Repo?

This repo is mainly for my own purposes while learning Python and programming concepts. But I will also continue to update this repo with coding examples an resources as I move along so others can use this as a resource to get started on their own programming journey.

What will one find in this repo:
- Python Code Examples
- Jupyter Notebooks with code snippets and explanations of the code
- Resources for getting help and diving deeper into Python
- Course Resources
- Books I've used and recommend

## How I have been using the material

**Courses**:
- Python for Beginners as a 'ramp-up' on Python.
- Automate the Boring Stuff with Python as a supplement to my learning.
- Google IT Automation with Python as the main course I wish to learn from. 

I found this set up to work for me the best.

**Books**:
- I use **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python** as the main book I use for reference and learning.
- I use **Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming** as another main source and use the projects for learning.  
- I use **Introducing Python** by *Bill Lubanovic* as a reference when needed.
- I use **Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science: Learning to Program with AI, Big Data and The Cloud** by *Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel* as another reference and to understand a topic deeper.
